# Introduction

Software safety is a growing and well-justified concern across government and industry, with a
recent [Linux foundation
plan](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/OpenSSF/OSS%20Mobilization%20Plan.pdf)
specifically calling for “moving software away from C and C++ to safer languages.”  Until now,
creating memory safety in a language like C++ has meant the addition of hard-to-satisfy lifetime
annotation requirements that significantly increase API complexity.  As an alternative, we present
an object model—implemented in the [Val research language](https://www.val-lang.dev/)—based on value
semantics; an idea already deeply ingrained in C++.  It turns out that by “going
all in” on value semantics, we gain three things at once:
- Memory safety by construction
- Thread safety by construction (Rust's “fearless concurrency”)
- A simple and powerful programming model

We believe that as the C++ committee considers its response to the safety crisis, understanding
the Val model could allow a safer C++ that is also simpler.

- Why is safety important?
- Related work on safety.

# Motivation and Scope

Safe is better than safer.
Annotation burden of aliasing restrictions is too high.

# The Val Object Model

- Details of the model
- Implications of the model

# Conclusion

- Not necessarily the answer for C++
- Syntax doesn't matter for C++
